Documentation Setup
====================

This is how I setup the project blog for this document.
If you create your own mobile-first project based on this repository,
you can simply add or replace items in these docs to your liking.
Then you won't need to setup the orphaned gh-pages branch.

If you'd like to setup docs / notes (blog) within your application
then you might find this helpful.

Setting up Tools
----------------------

This blog uses sphinx-docs_ and ablog_, just as http://blog.readthedocs.com now does.

To set these to appear as project docs, a separate output directory was made for
sphin-docs, named (in this case) after the repository ``mobile-first``.
To make this output directory hold the rendered documentation,
first make sure it does not exist in the docs area.
Then, make a git-submodule to the main directory, thus::

    $ git submodule add -b gh-pages git@github.com:yarko/mobile-first.git ./docs/mobile-first


where ``mobile-first`` (repository and target) is replaced with your repository.
This makes the repository a git-submodule to itself.
Now, following the pattern shown on https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually
do the following::

    $ cd docs/mobile-first
    $ git checkout --orphan gh-pages
    $ git rm -rf .
    # Note: the new branch won't appear in the branch list until your first commit
    $ touch .nojekyll


You'll notice, the makefile for this repository (under the ``build`` command)
has ``mobile-first`` as the output directory.  Now::

    $ make build
    $ git add --all
    $ git commit -a -m 'first ablog build to gh-pages'
    $ git push origin gh-pages


Give it a few minutes, then you should be able to navigate to your equivalent path of
http://yarko.github.io/mobile-first
